# AVA Mark 1 Release Notes 

### Welcome to the Mark 1 Update of Ava, these features are not that exciting but this is just the begging of AVA and there will be more updates along the way that are cool ðŸ˜Ž. So lets make this quick. 

### Here are the updates that we are gonna cover 
- `Authentication (Stable Build)` 
- `Spotify (Alpha Build)`
- `NLP (Still in Development)`
#### `Authentication` So when ever you run the AVA programm, you need to authenticate, because AVA needs to know that wether either me or  my family members. How this works is it sends an email to out inbox with our response is correct it will give us access. 

#### `Spotify` For Mark 1 it searches for music, but it is just searches with a query, in later updates I am making it to recommended me music to me and creates a playist with the recommed music. 

#### `NLP` Natural Language Proccessing is really important if you are trying to build an AI system that runs your home. For the time being it just extracts the entity and sentiment, this is still developent and we need to make changes to it. 

#### Thanks for reading the Mark 1 Realse Notes, I will be releasing more updates every week, if you have any question please reach out to my socials and you want to connect with other developers please feel free to join our disocrd ðŸ‘‰ https://discord.gg/HfwC3fCfa3
