# Ava 

Ava stands for Advanced Voice Assitant. Her mission in life is simple it is to help me with my daily tasks. Currently, she is running on my computer and only responds to my voice and the voice of my parents. She is still in production mode there will updates that will come along the way.

# Packages and abilities 

Here are how Ava works and the packages it uses,

* `speech_recognition`  Ava uses speech_recognition to detect voices. Ava uses a python package called speech_recognition. It is a popular speech recognition package, and I recommend using this package if you want to build your own  AI Bot

* `natural language processing`  Ava uses the google cloud natural language API to find the entity and sentiment. It is beneficial because you don't want to hard code all of the commands. 
  
#### Abilities of AVA 
* `Authentication` Before you can talk with AVA, she needs to know that if it's me (Shashank) so it sends an email to my inbox with a verification code, which s randomly generated. If my response is equal to the verification code, then it will speak. This feature is cool because I don't want strangers to gain access.
